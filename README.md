## Welcome to a new evolution in Solo Bitcoin Mining!

### MintSolo Platform - Beta v0.0.1

With this release, we are introducing our community app store version of the MintSolo, Solo Bitcoin Mining Platform for Umbrel.

This release allows you to run the MintSolo-Platform on Umbrel along with your favorite Bitcoin Node (Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots). 

# About MintSolo

The MintSolo-Platform allows you to solo mine for Bitcoin using your own local Bitcoin node and the MintSolo mining platform. However, unlike other solo Bitcoin mining apps on Umbrel, we do not leave you isolated from the outside world when it comes to analytics. Instead, we provide you with analytics about your local node and miners, along with aggregated metrics from other solo mining nodes around the world.

Here are some of the current and future metrics you will enjoy with MintSolo;

Currently Available Metrics

- Bitcoin Stats - current block, Network Hashrate, Difficulty, Transactions, Price
- Top 10 Mining Devices - provides a ranking of mining devices in the MintSolo ecosystem
- Active Mining Devices - provides the total number of mining devices in the MintSolo ecosystem
- Hashrate History Trend - provides a 36-hour trend of MintSolo miner hashrate
- Difficulty - Current and Best
- Workers - hashrate, best difficulty, uptime, last seen
- Worker Trend - total workers and individual worker trend
